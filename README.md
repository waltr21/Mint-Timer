# Mint-Timer

A simple rubiks cube timer that keeps track of solves for various cubes between 2x2-7x7. All sove times are written to storage to text files.

The GUI was created using the Javafx libraries. Unfortunately, this was developed before I discovered the Javafx scenebuilder tool. The entire GUI class could be compacted into .fxml files, but as of right now they're not. I'll release an updated version with .fxml files sometime in the future.
